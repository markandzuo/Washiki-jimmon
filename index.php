		<h2>Food</h2>
		<p>Japanese cuisine is a Japanese way of eating, and it has developed a very unique food culture after a long period of development. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Japan gradually formed the current food culture. After that, influenced by foreign cultures, the Japanese diet began to join foreign cuisines while retaining its original features and incorporated them into Japanese cuisine. This has thus formed the Japanese cuisine we have seen so far.</p>
