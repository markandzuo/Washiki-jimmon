    <h1>Japanese cuisine has three main characteristics.</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>the Japanese like "fresh" and "raw" food.</li>
        <p>According to the Japanese concept, fresh food is the most nutritious and the most vigorous period of life in the body. 
            The best period of consumption of any organism is its freshness. And because Japan is an island country, surrounded by the sea, we can see that 
            Japan's most common sushi and sashimi are made from raw seafood. </p>
        <li>the Japanese value the "balance" of food.</li>
        <p>Japanese cuisine is also known as "Washoku". This refers to the harmonious integration of various foods in Japanese culture. In China, there is 
            a saying of "yin and yang". In addition to the influence of China, the Japanese also believe that food is also divided into "yin" and "yang". 
            The combination of food needs to ensure the balance of "yin and yang".</p>
        <p>On the other hand, seasonality is also one of the important definitions of “Washoku”. Seasonal circulation deepens into Japanese culture, 
            which is also reflected in their dress and food. Japanese people respect nature. They don't like cross-season food. They think that specific 
            agricultural products can be harvested at specific time and made into food to ensure their nutrition and flavor.</p>
        <li> the art of eating is very important in Japanese food culture.</li>
        <p>Friends who have been to Japan should resonate with Japanese cuisine. It is delicious than Japanese food. Japanese cuisine is more pleasing to the eye. 
            Through careful matching, the Japanese made the food shape perfect, giving a visually significant impact. Even the sashimi sold in the supermarket is quite 
            smart in shape and color.</p>
    </ol>
    
    <h1>Japanese traditional food recommendation</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Sushi and Sashimi</li>
        <p>One of my favorite Japanese food is also the most famous Japanese food. The common ones are salmon and tuna sushi and sashimi. Personally recommend traditional salmon sushi 
            and caviar sushi. If you don't like raw food, try eel sashimi. Sashimi made from cooked food is also very common.</p>
        
        <li>Ramen</li>
        <p>Ramen is also a Japanese food. The usual ramen is tonkotsu soup and miso soup, which I also highly recommend. Other ramen with spicy curry soup or fish soup, friends who are
            interested must go to Japan to taste.</p>
        
        <li>Tamagoyaki</li>
        <p>Sukiyaki is a Japanese-style hot pot that is generally made from meat (usually beef) plus other ingredients such as vegetables and other meatballs. Unlike Chinese hot pot, 
            Sukiyaki is usually not spicy and will be served with unstirred raw eggs. Usually, food will dip the raw eggs after cooking, then eat.</p>
    
        <li>Takoyaki</li>
        <p>Takoyaki is a Japanese specialty snack, usually a spherical food cut from flour and octopus. Takoyaki is usually a Japanese street food served with mayonnaise and seaweed. 
            Highly recommended for friends who visit Japan.</p>
        
        <li>Tempura</li>
        <p>Tempura is a Japanese dish made by frying vegetables or seafood. Common tempura is made from shrimp, but there are other types of tempura, such as scallop tempura. 
            Must-eat food when going to Japan</p>
