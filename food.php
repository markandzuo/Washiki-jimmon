            <h2>First, the Japanese like "fresh" and "raw" food</h2>
            <p>According to the Japanese concept, fresh food is the most nutritious and the most vigorous period of life in the body.
            The best period of consumption of any organism is its freshness. And because Japan is an island country, surrounded by the
            sea, we can see that Japan's most common sushi and sashimi are made from raw seafood.</p>

            <h2>Second, the Japanese value the "balance" of food.</h2>
            <p>Japanese cuisine is also known as "Washoku". This refers to the harmonious integration of various foods in Japanese culture. In China,
            there is a saying of "yin and yang". In addition to the influence of China, the Japanese also believe that food is also divided into "yin"
            and "yang". The combination of food needs to ensure the balance of "yin and yang".</p>
            <p>On the other hand, seasonality is also one of the important definitions of “Washoku”. Seasonal circulation deepens into Japanese culture,
            which is also reflected in their dress and food. Japanese people respect nature. They don't like cross-season food.
            They think that specific agricultural products can be harvested at specific time and made into food to ensure their nutrition and flavor.</p>

            <p>Friends who have been to Japan should resonate with Japanese cuisine. It is delicious than Japanese food. Japanese cuisine is more pleasing to the eye.
            Through careful matching, the Japanese made the food shape perfect, giving a visually significant impact.
